### Description

There were some missing files in the zip - apologies for that guys... fixed now ;-)

This project and it's associated tutorial show how to do professional resampling on an image in Visual Basic. Some advanced OOP techniques are used to accomplish this and you get a choice of 15 different resampling techniques including box filtering, gauss filter, spline filter ...

This code was converted from an existing C++ implementation I found whilst strolling around the next search engines ;-)

Check out the tute for this project at http://www25.brinkster.com/mferris.
